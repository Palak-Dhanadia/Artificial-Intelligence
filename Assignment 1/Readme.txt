It is good. It could be better if your can explain your algorithms in more detail.

7/15 for 2.2.
For 2.2(b), there is no optimal algorithm for all situations, so it is important to give a clear answer "no".
For 2.2(c), we need to compare and elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages of each of the three algorithms. The existing answer could be more complete.
For 2.2(d), we notice that the circle line can cause loops, but so can the overall network structure.
Besides, we notice that the initial direction of search can make a big difference to the comparison, because if affects different algorithms in different ways.

7/10 for 2.3.
The solution is okay. A good idea is adding in a cost for the time taken to change lines, which makes the final path more helpful in real world environment.
